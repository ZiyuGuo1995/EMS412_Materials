They can go anywhere inside your code or even following lines of code you want to compute. The comments are started by the # character and you just place your message after this. When python is executed, if it see the # it just ignores this and whatever follows it. \n",

    "\n",
    "I guarantee you will spend the vast majority of your time, particularly when learning coding, debugging errors in your code. YOU WILL I PROMISE YOU! Errors and removing them is part of your learning curve. Sometimes they are difficult to find and can drive you crazy! This part is only conquered with experience, so the more you code the better you will get. SO DO ALL THE EXERCISES I GIVE YOU - AND MORE :)\n",
    "\n",
    "But as a starter, when you write code it is essential to check it produces the correct answer. I very often print to screen many of the executions and check that the code is correct. Very often i do this line by line when possible. So don't write an entire lump of code and then debug. Do it slowly or it will get messy!!!\n",
