Thoughts on Wk1-Wk4
W1. Data types, after variable assignment.
    Operators on different data types.
W2. Basic program structure before if statement. (sequence, branch, and loop)
    While loop in loop section.
W3. Stress the function of indent in the nested loop section
    Inline function with lambda expression
W4. Import command, adding import xxx as xxx, and from xxx import xxx, and from xxx import xxx as xxx
