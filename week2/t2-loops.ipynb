    "This week we are going to cover some very powerful tools of programming, namely loops and if statements. We will start with loops here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops allow us to execute repetitive computations with just a few lines of code. To demonstrate this to you we will do something pretty useless but it will show you how the basic code notation works.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we will do is get the computer to write out \"hello world\" to the screen 10 times. We will use the:\n",
    "\n",
    "print('hello world')\n",
    "\n",
    "statement to do this task. One way to achieve the aim is to write this out 10 times, one line after the other. Clearly this is not feasible, particularly if i wanted 100 or 1000 print statements, so we can use loops instead. First I will show you the code and then we will go through what has happened.\n",

    "This has used just 2 lines of code to perform our task, but there is a lot going on here so we will go through each line in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first look at line 1 and this is where the loop is initiated. In python a loop is defined by the words \"for\" and \"in\", and these have meaning like you would say in English - which I will come back to you very shortly.  But in this line there is also the \"i\" and \"range(10)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the \"range(10)\" to python means a list of the first 10 numbers, starting from 0 (don't forget this!!!). So it is fine to just think of it as a list of numbers 0,1,2,...9. Also, I can change the number 10 to any integer value and the \"range(number)\" will be a list of numbers 0,1,2,3,.... number-1 .\n",
    "\n",
    "In the loop, the \"i\" term is a variable that takes on each value contained in that list of range(10), one at a time. That is, it will take one the value 0, then 1, then 2, and so on up to the value 9. Each time it takes on the value it will execute whatever code you want inside the loop, which will follow on from the \"for loop\" statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here is the question, how many lines of code should be executed within the loop and how does python know when to stop??? The answer: Now remember I warned you about not indenting your code, i.e. always starting your commands on the left hand side? This is because indenting code means something very specific to python, and now you will see this in use with loop. Following your for loop statement in line 1, you must now indent all the following lines that you want executed within the loop. You can see this on line 2 where it start 3 spaces in! Although there is only one line of code in this example, you can do as many as you wish, just keep the indentation to the same number of spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will now know what lines to execute by the indented lines, and when you want the loop to stop, just go back to writing the code in the left hand side again. For example, have a look at how this loop prints two statements and then exits the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will see the : at the end of the line initatiing the loop. Don't forget this, it is needed so python knows to begin the loop process. You can now literally read the initial line in the \"for loop\" statement as:  for each variable \"i\" in the range of 0 to 10, do the following lines:\n"
