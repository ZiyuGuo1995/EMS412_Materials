    "In this tutorial we are going to learn about \"if statements\". \"If statements\" allow you to execute parts of a code when certain conditions are met, and not to execute them when those conditions are not met. You can also build up and check a series of different conditions and to only execute bits of code specific to these conditions. Again it is easier to show you a simple \"if statement\" example to illustrate how this works, and we will go through the lines after.\n",

    "So you will hopefully see the statement 'your number is greater than 10 ' printed out. Now you can have a play with this and change the my_number variable's values to greater or lower than 10, also have a look at when its value is 10, does the print work? We will find out why shortly."

    "So how does this work? Firstly it all starts with the \"if\" word to tell python what it is about to perform an if statement. After this python need to check whether something is true or not - that is, it needs to check a logical statement and determine whether it is True or False. In our case, we want to see whether our number is greater than 10. So you will see that, following the if statement, there is the bit \"my_number > 10 :\"  Here the > is the greater than sign, and it works in the same way as you are used to in your maths class. So this statement is checked and would be True if the my_number is greater than 10, and False if if it not. If it is True then python will execute the code that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here is the trick again! If the condition is found to be True - i.e our my_number is greater than 10, then how does it know how many lines to execute and when to stop? Well, once again it comes back to that indentation of the code, and in fact works in an identical way to the \"for loops\"! That is, if the statement is True, python will execute all the following lines that are indented, and will stop when the code goes back to the original position. So in our example there are only two lines, one of which is a comment. But these lines are indented (4 spaces in)  so will be executed when \"my_number > 10\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So to illustrate this working with multiple lines of code within the if statement and something following its completion we could write:"
