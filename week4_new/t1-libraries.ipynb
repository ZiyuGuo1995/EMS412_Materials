    "One of the last things to cover before we will start doing some interesting and useful computations is to introduce you to python libraries. Libraries are pertinent to all computing languages, python included, and during your degree you will be introduced to some of the main ones to get you up and running with some engineering problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries are essentially a suite of pre-built functions that will perform some class of operations that are commonly used in programming languages. Essentially these are tools that have been created by someone else so you don't have to, you just pick them up and use them!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are thousands of libraries available in python doing all types of different operations. Later in this module you will be introduced to a \"linear algebra\" library that allows you create matrices and vectors of any size and do all the multiplication and operations that you may have seen in your A-levels (don't worry if not) in a split second. But there are so many others that are so useful, including libraries that visualize and process data in much the same way as you may have done in Excel, there are other where you can get up and running with AI and machine learning in a very short space of time (perhaps for your 3rd year project??). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise I will introduce you to the math library. This allows you to perform all the math operations that you see on your calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to use a particular library we have to load them up before using them. To do this we use the \"import\" command, and again it is best to show you by example."
